# linux-config

This is my linux configuration. In order to apply it execute the `init.sh` script.
The `neovim` config requires the version to be 0.8.0 or later.

## Installation of `neovim` on Ubuntu

1. Go to https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases
2. Use the `wget` command to download the appropriate debian package `nvim-linux64.deb`
3. Install using `sudo apt install ./nvim-linux64.deb`

## Usage on WSL

A Nerdfont has to be used to display all characters in `neovim` correctly.
Go to https://webinstall.dev/nerdfont/ to install one.
